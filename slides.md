# #Hackathon Tips

- Focus on important things.
- This is not a competition.
- Don't spend too much time on the idea.

<!--
* Don't worry about how your website looks or any small optimizations you can make. Focus on shipping something fast, even if it's not optimized or doesn't look great. If even one person can use your app right now and get help, consider that your solution already won!

* If you can't figure out your app, idea, leave it, go help some other team! Help as much as you can! And yes, I believe in karma, maybe not the direct meaning, but I believe whether seeds you grow, that's what you are gonna harvest in the end!

* Don't compete against each other! It's easy to get carried away in the thought of making your app better than others so you can be the one that helped other people. Remember, even if your project never lunches, you already did a great cause by just showing up!
